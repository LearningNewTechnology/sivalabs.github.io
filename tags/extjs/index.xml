      <description>I was asked to review &amp;#8220;Enterprise Application Development with Ext JS and Spring&amp;#8221; book by Packtpub guys and here is my review on the book.

      <description>After one month of evaluation of the frameworks and tools, i choose ExtJS for UI and Spring/SpringMVC for business layer for my pet project.
Again by using ExtJS we can send data to server by form submits or as request parameters or in json format through Ajax requests. ExtJS uses JSON format in many situations to hold data. So I thought using JSON as data exchange format between EXTJS and Spring will be consistent.</description>
