      <description>I am glad to announce that my second book PrimeFaces Beginner&amp;#8217;s Guide is published.
As many of us know PrimeFaces is leading JSF component library for JSF based web applications. This PrimeFaces Beginner&amp;#8217;s Guide book targets the Java developers with basic knowledge on JSF and jQuery and covers most of the commonly used PrimeFaces components.
 Good news is that PrimeFaces Beginner&amp;#8217;s Guide book covers the latest PrimeFaces 4.0 version features such as Client Side Validations (CSV) framework, Dialog Framework, Search Expressions, Sticky Component and many other enhancement as well.</description>

      <description>JSF2 has in-built support for form validations using Bean Validation API(JSR-303).
In my previous article PrimeFaces 3 Tutorial : Introduction &amp;amp; Form Validation , I have explained how to validate forms using JSF tags inside JSF xhtml pages.
Now Let us see how we can validate the forms using HibernateValidator which is reference implementation of JSR-303.
Note: Integrating JSR-303 with JSF2 doesn&amp;#8217;t have anything to do with PrimeFaces 3.
But I am planning to write a series of articles on PrimeFaces and JSR-303 integration is a part of it.</description>

      <description>PrimeFaces is a component library for JSF and has huge component support.
Working with PrimeFaces is very much easy because there is a single jar, no mandatory other dependencies, no mandatory configuration is required.
Ok, in this tutorial I am going to explain how to create a Maven based PrimeFaces project and create a simple registration for and validate the form.
I am using JDK1.6.26 and Tomcat 7.0.32.
Step#1
Create Maven Project and add the following repositories, dependencies in pom.</description>

      <description>Recently I got a wonderful opportunity to work with JSF and I couldn&amp;#8217;t stop myself sharing my feelings on JSF with everyone.
By god&amp;#8217;s grace till last month i didn&amp;#8217;t a chance to work on JSF in my career. But recently i have to work on a project developed in JSF 1.x.
After spending few days on JSF technology I realized that JSF is not only a web framework and we can use it for several purposes.</description>
