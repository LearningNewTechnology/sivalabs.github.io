      <description>In Java world, JPA/Hibernate is the most popular and widely used framework. When it comes to overall performance of a software system database persistence layer plays the crucial role. The tricky part with JPA/Hibernate is it is very easy to get started but very very hard to master. This is where Vlad Mihalcea&amp;#8216;s High-Performance Java Persistence book helps you a lot.

The High-Performance Java Persistence book is not just another Hibernate book saying you put this annotation here and call that method there and you are done.</description>

Also PrimeFaces has a wonderful showcase (http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/home.jsf) and documentation (http://www.primefaces.org/documentation.html) on their website.     When I first heard about &amp;#8220;PrimeFaces Cookbook‚Äù I was very excited because this is the first book on PrimeFaces and usually cookbooks contain lot of tips for commonly faced issues and recipes for common use cases.
