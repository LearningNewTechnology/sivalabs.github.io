      <description>Generally we write our javascript and css styles in separate file and include them in JSPs using  and  tags.
To include those resource we can use either relative URL or absolute URL.
If you use absolute URL you need to include the context root name which is not a good practice.
Later if you want to change the context root name you need to update in several places.</description>

      <description>Many people know about how RequestDispatcher.forward() and response.sendRedirect() works.
RequestDispatcher.forward() is generally called Server side redirection and is used to forward to a resource within the same application. That resource could be a JSP or another Servlet.
response.sendRedirect() is generally called as Client side redirection as it issues a new request from the browser. This method is used to redirect to another resource within the same application or to the resource in some other application running in the same web container or can redirect to any other resource running in someother web container.</description>
