      <description>I am &amp;nbsp;Software Developer, specifically Java Developer, spending most of the time writing back-end part of the applications. I can write basic HTML/JavaScript/CSS stuff to get the things done when needed. I didn&amp;#8217;t have much passion on HTML/JavaScript and neither I am good at web development. I just has good enough knowledge to get the front-end work done for my requirements. Whenever I find sometime I tried to experiment with some cool back-end technologies like SpringBoot or JavaEE7, I never spend my weekends learning any front-end technologies.</description>

      <description>AngularJS provides filter feature which can be used to format input value or to filter an Array with the given matching input criteria. For example you can use &amp;#8216;date&amp;#8217; filter to format a Date value into human readable Date representation like MM-DD-YYYY as {{dob | date}}.
On the other hand there are Array filtering feature which is very useful while filtering data from an Array of JavaScript objects. The Array filtering is very commonly used with a Table along with ng-repeat directive.</description>

      <description>In my previous post AngularJS Tutorial: Getting Started with AngularJS we have seen how to setup an application using SpringBoot + AngularJS + WebJars. But it&amp;#8217;s a kind of quick start tutorial where I haven&amp;#8217;t explained much about AngularJS modules, controllers and services. Also it is a single screen (only one route) application.
In this part-2 tutorial, we will take a look at what are Angular modules, controllers and services and how to configure and use them.</description>
