      <description>In Java world, JPA/Hibernate is the most popular and widely used framework. When it comes to overall performance of a software system database persistence layer plays the crucial role. The tricky part with JPA/Hibernate is it is very easy to get started but very very hard to master. This is where Vlad Mihalcea&amp;#8216;s High-Performance Java Persistence book helps you a lot.

The High-Performance Java Persistence book is not just another Hibernate book saying you put this annotation here and call that method there and you are done.</description>

      <description>I would like to let you know that I have updated/added the following sections to my SpringBoot : Learn By Example book.

Additions to existing chapters:  Working with Multiple Databases Exposing JPA entities with bi-directional references through RESTful services  In some of our applications we need to work with multiple databases. For example, we may have a primary database and a reporting database where most the application uses primary database and the application reports will be generated out of reporting database data.</description>

      <description>We all start our new projects by promising to follow best practices and good design principles etc.
But over the time business rules change and developers keep adding new features or updates existing logic.
In this process the common mistake done by many teams is putting if-else conditions here and there instead of coming up with better design to support enhancements. Once these feature turn on/off flags and behavior branching logic started creeping into code then overtime it might become un-maintainable mess.</description>

      <description>Hurray&amp;#8230;My first book &amp;#8220;Java Persistence with MyBatis3&amp;#8221; is published. I would like to thank Packt Publishers for giving me this opportunity to write on my favorite framework MyBatis.
For most of the software applications data persistence is a key and important aspect. In Java land we have many ways of implementing persistence layer starting from low level JDBC to fancy ORM frameworks.
JDBC is too low level API and needs to write a lot of boilerplate code.</description>

Also PrimeFaces has a wonderful showcase (http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/home.jsf) and documentation (http://www.primefaces.org/documentation.html) on their website.     When I first heard about &amp;#8220;PrimeFaces Cookbook‚Äù I was very excited because this is the first book on PrimeFaces and usually cookbooks contain lot of tips for commonly faced issues and recipes for common use cases.
