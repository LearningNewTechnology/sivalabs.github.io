      <description>At times we stuck with some weird problem which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense and gives no clue where to start debugging the issue also.

      <description>It is evening 6.45 PM in Chicago and I am back from office,took shower and relaxing. My employer arranged nice stay at a decent restaurant with all goodies.But I have mixed feelings of excitement and emptiness.
I am very excited because it is my first on-site visit to USA and tomorrow I am going to see some places in Chicago Loop, specifically 108 floors Willis Tower. On the other hand I am missing something.</description>

      <description>Hi,
My name is Siva and by profession I am a Software Developer. I do blog about the technology stuff that I learned at http://sivalabs.in.
I wanted to start blogging about non-technical stuff and here I am with my new blog http://sivaprasadreddy.github.io.
Going forward you can find my thoughts on various interesting things in life here.
Stay tuned :-)
